# Machine-Learning-Open-Cookbook
This repository contains Machine Learning implementations for anyone to study. This is supposed to be used as teaching or self-study material, so the repository is structured in two branches:

- `solutions`, which includes Machine Learning implementations
- `homework`, which includes only class and function definitions so that anyone can try to implement the algorithms by themselves. This is the main branch of the repository.

Each method or model has its own folder, in which you can find, among others, the following files:

- `lib.py`, which contains the class definitions and implementations.
- `data.csv`, which is a toy dataset used to test the algorithm.
- `notebook_[XX].ipynb`, where you can test your implementations and hopefully help you gain some insights along the way. The `XX` is used to denote the order in which it should be read.

Additionally, the `solutions` branch may have a `TUTORIAL.md` file for each of the models explained, which is supposed to be a self contained blog post for the model in question.
